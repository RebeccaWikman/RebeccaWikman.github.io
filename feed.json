The assignment was to write a concept document for a game based on a prompt. </p>\n<p>The prompt I selected was for a fantasy game. The three narrative pillars that work as the foundation for all other choices in this design can be found on pages 2-3. This document consists of worldbuilding, main characters, some tropes involved, a brief rundown of the storyline (with gaps to fill in during the development process) and discussion of the main themes of the game.</p>\n<p>I do not own any of the concept images in this document and they are all linked back to their original sources. They are merely used as mockups to get a base idea of some designs.</p>\n<h2>The Document</h2>\n<p><embed style=\"width: 100%;\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/Mirror Image Concept Document.pdf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\"></embed></p>\n<h2>On Writing A Concept</h2>\n<p>There is something to be said for a thorough concept document. There are of course limits to how thorough one should be, given that no plan survives first contact with development without any flexibility, but I like to operate on the \"hit by a bus\" principle with my documentation. Thorough enough documentation means that no personal absence can hold up the process to the point of stopping it. </p>\n<p>In all game projects I've been a part of at Futuregames, I've taken some part in writing down the concepts for them. I've mainly done concept design, narrative design, and detail design for game mechanics. The prompt for this course called for us to anticipate and answer as many questions about our concepts as we could upfront. I found that a very useful rule for any game documentation. Every part of a game, however basic, needs to be explained in order for a team to be able to put it into practice. </p>",

It is a dating sim with a mystery element, currently unnamed. </p>\n<p>The premise is this: the player is a detective whose case has culminated in a search for their suspect at a speed dating event. They have a notebook with clues (increased gradually through flashbacks as the game progresses) and their mission is to go through the event undercover and find out who has committed the thefts they are investigating without any of the suspects catching on. If they can move through the dates smoothly enough, the suspect is bound to slip up. Eventually. </p>\n<p>This will be a short experience with a focus on humour and characters. The goal is for the player to come out of it feeling accomplished and invested in at least one character. I am making this game using the Fungus interactive storytelling plugin in Unity. </p>\n<p>I will be documenting this game in the \"Games\" tab once it is finished. If you have any questions before then, I am happy to answer them.

A healthy mix of humorous and bizarre, this game invites players to do some soul searching as they escape the final prison for all wicked souls. Solve the puzzles, make the right (or wrong) decisions in doing so, and prepare for your final judgment.</p>\n<p>For this production, I was a part-time narrative and concept designer. I was mostly responsible for the narrative concept, dialogue writing, and playtesting.</p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">My Responsibilities:</span><br></strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part of designing the game genre, concept, and core pillars.</li>\n<li>Part of setting the scope of the game and detail design of scene progression.</li>\n<li>Part of puzzle planning and detail design.</li>\n<li>Part of writing character concepts (narrative).</li>\n<li>Part of writing cutscenes and character dialogue.</li>\n<li>Writing description for the game's online page.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Process</strong></span></p>\n<p>For this project, we were given a painting as a theme. The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymous Bosch. As expected, there were a lot of ways we could interpret this. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-xs.jpg 300w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-sm.jpg 480w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-md.jpg 768w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/responsive/The_Garden_of_earthly_delights-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"683\"></figure>\n<p>There are three sections to this painting, representing Heaven (left), Earth (middle) and Hell (right). As the name of the game suggests, we chose to set our game in a setting that is an interpretation of Hell. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Hell, Hel, Hades</strong></span></p>\n<p>Though we loved the idea of the chaos going on in the painting and a lot of the art is inspired by it (more on that below), our concept for the setting was a mix of the concept of Hell from three different religions. As the player goes through the game, they meet other characters who are all (in their minds) in their own religion's version of a hellish afterlife. They have each performed a sin from their own cultures to land themselves there. Each character has a corresponding sin scroll (pickups the player can find) that can be given to them to trigger an extra interaction. </p>\n<p>These characters' origins give the player some clue as to how to find progression to do with that character's section. The Greek is there because of hubris, and so the player must complete a test of intelligence to get his attention. The viking is there because of cowardice, and so the player can scare him into helping them. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Concept and Narrative</strong></span></p>\n<p>These were the two sections I was most part of during this production. I worked with another narrative designer (Felicia Uddling) to write a narrative outline, dialogue, and cutscenes, as well as some concept documents for the game. We then moved on to a design document which was completed by the whole group. To that, I added a detail design for the puzzles so that they would be simpler to organise and implement.</p>\n<p>We began by planning the project together in a Miro board, in which we placed all the inspiration we could think of that would fit an adventurous point-and-click. Many ideas were discussed and the group had a good rapport. We settled on what we wanted to do and Felicia and I began to write an outline and character concepts while the other designers began level blockouts and artists began to plan out assets. </p>\n<p>I updated concepts and scripts as needed for the rest of the production and participated in playtesting when needed.</p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Awful, but Also Funny</strong></span></p>\n<p>Like the Garden, we wanted this experience to be both absurd and humorous in equal measure. To do this, we put together a cast of characters that would fit such a worldview. The environment, assets, and sound effects together with some sardonic dialogue make for a fun experience in which the player hopefully gets to delight in questioning everything that happens along the way. From the gate, who insists on snacking on apples with teeth, to Manny, whose dialogue is accompanied by fun and thoughtful sound effects, to Anubis, whose entrance is meant to be as bizarre as it is grand. Each section comes with its own challenge that requires a logic that, while absurd, gradually begins to make sense. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/greken.jpg\" data-size=\"485x927\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/greken-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"485\" height=\"927\"></a>\n<figcaption>The Greek character</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/nubis.JPG.jpg\" data-size=\"274x468\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/nubis.JPG-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"274\" height=\"468\"></a>\n<figcaption>Anubis</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/babooo.jpg\" data-size=\"777x620\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/babooo-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"575\"></a>\n<figcaption>Baboo, the production mascot</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/cerb2.JPG.jpg\" data-size=\"926x521\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/6/gallery/cerb2.JPG-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Cerberus, one of the obstacles the player comes across</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>We noticed in playtesting that this was the experience players most often had, and that was exactly what we were aiming for. I am really glad that the environmental storytelling came together so well with the narrative one; practicing that is one of my goals in studying at Future Games. The concept the team put together worked out very well, and as a result, this is one of my favourite projects from my time here.</p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CVwcz-9Z1v059D9mUTOXvM8AABAQrzJA/preview\"></iframe></div></p>",

However, to do this, players must first avoid the enemy team and their use of the weaponised dodgeballs on the court. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>My Roles</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Narrative designer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Concept designer</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scripter</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>My Responsibilities</strong></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Part of general concept development</li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of writing and maintaining concept document and process documentation for the project </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of gameplay and level mechanics </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of world building and narrative design (player teams and announcer voice lines)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Collecting and implementing suitable game sounds</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of recording and implementing voice lines </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Wrote overviews and a pitch to present to clients (Future Games teachers and project jury)</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Part of regular playtesting to ensure quality gameplay</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>This was the second game project I was a part of at Future Games. The requirements were for it to be multiplayer and a combination of two sports. We chose American football and dodgeball. The scifi elements were added in just for the fun of it. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>The Vision</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our objective for this game was a fun, chaotic experience that players could share with others in the style of console party games. The theme for the project was to combine sports, and we came to the conclusion that American football and dodgeball would slot right into that concept. It made for a lot of fun, emergent gameplay, which was exactly the goal we set out for.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found it remarkably simple and fun to adapt to the group vision in this project. We had a clear agreement on what we wanted and whenever details changed, they were easy to adapt and modify. The important part for me here was that I knew when people wanted things to change, and keeping it cohesive through those changes was a fun challenge for me. </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Ball_Spawner_01.jpg\" data-size=\"670x921\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Ball_Spawner_01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"670\" height=\"921\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ball Spawner</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Character-concept.jpg\" data-size=\"1555x1755\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Character-concept-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"813\"></a>\n<figcaption>Character Concept Art</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Controller_Scheme.png\" data-size=\"1378x558\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Controller_Scheme-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"292\"></a>\n<figcaption>Controls</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Environment_Concept_03.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x1483\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Environment_Concept_03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"356\"></a>\n<figcaption>Arena Concept Art</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Communication</strong></span></p>\n<p>This was another project in which I learned a lot about the communication within a team. As this was a bigger team, there was more need for me to stay attentive to how everyone was working to keep in line with the bigger picture. We were more divided into departments this time with art (2D and 3D) and design (designers and programming) needed to stay on target in parallell with each other. </p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We had a scrum master for this project and the communication in the team was great. We had room to test, dismiss, and use more ideas than we had originally thought we could, and daily standups helped to keep that process quick and efficient. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Narrative</span> </strong></p>\n<p>As this is a focused, isolated party game, there was not much room for a linear narrative. Another narrative designer (Erik Wahlström) and I adapted to this by adding a narrator and team names to the UI and lineup. Players can choose to join either the Moon Riders or the Handsome Honeybadgers, and an enthusiastic announcer (in the style of Smash Brothers) announces each start, half time, and goal. </p>\n<p>Due to time constraints and some adjustments in the tone of the game, a lot of what was written for it had to be cut, so we edited from more elaborate voice lines to ones that were quicker and more to the point. Though perhaps not my first choice, doing this was an interesting exercise in prioritising what is best for the game, and I am happy with the result of it. </p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>S</strong><strong>cripting</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also stepped outside my comfort zone with this project and took a more active part in the scripting of it than I did with Escape in Frogress. I learned a lot about not just the technological aspect, but also of the structure the team needs to be effective with it. This was also my first time working with a team of programmers in the group. </span></p>\n<p>I was part of working on the UI as well as some quick-and-dirty prototyping of some of the ideas we had for mechanics. In this way, we were able to playtest all of our ideas and choose which ones would fit best within the scope we had to work with. The result is a game that was fun to test and more fun to show off to others at the end of the production. </p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffD1dvwsDMY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></p>",

We were presented with two requirements: that the game be multiplayer and that the characters be made up of more than one part in some way (we chose a loose connection between the character's body itself and the tongue (a grappling hook)).</p>\n<p>As a team, we sat down and settled o<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">n an idea by offering and discussing smaller concept pitches. The winning concept was a game about frogs, suggested by Oana Galan (a 3D artist). Once we had a base idea, we divided into groups for each aspect of a first playable, to be done at the end of the week. I was part of the level design and did the first blockout of it. I then worked with artists to continue developing the level. </span></p>\n<p>In the second week, I was responsible for narrative (voice line script), playtesting, and creating the pitch for the project to be pres<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">ented to the school. I was also the one who presented our pitch to the jury. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>A New Experience</strong></span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was my first game project at Future Games. I was very familiar with the concept of creating a narrative and creative writing, and translating that to game production was something of a challenge, but one that was fun to take on. I've toyed with narrative concepts in games before, but that was more linear stories. This was a matter of flavour for an otherwise focused experience, and writing a script for it was a lot of fun.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The concept of a narrator like in nature documentaries was a joking suggestion at first, but the group accepted it quickly and I began to watch clips to try to get the word choice as similar as possible. The dry humour was a fun component to add in.  </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/Orange-Frog-Midair.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-xs.png 300w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-sm.png 480w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-md.png 768w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-lg.png 1024w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-xl.png 1360w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1040\"></figure>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/897052870%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-BNn9rfpFpqu&amp;color=%2300cc11&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-267311361\" title=\"Sage\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-267311361/vo-line04/s-BNn9rfpFpqu\" title=\"VO Line04\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">VO Line04</a></div>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Learning Communication</strong></span></p>\n<p>A big part of what I learned was how the communication in a game dev team works. I had worked with communication in teaching before, but this was new to me. I worked on the level, the concept, and the voice lines that play randomly throughout the game, and each part required a lot of communication with the other designers and the artists.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was part of the level layout and design in this project, and as such I kept up communication with the 3D artists on what we needed for the level and how we should implement it. They taught me a lot about the visual depth and readability of a level as well, which I think was one of the most valuable bits of information I got from it. Regular standups and check-ins also ensured that I knew how, where, and when the other designers were working with the mechanics and characters, as well as the camera view. </span></p>\n<p>Forming an idea as a team was entirely new. I have collaborated before, but not in a group bigger than four. Settling on a base idea and adapting to it was surprisingly fun, as I had to find new avenues of influencing it. The idea of parodying a nature documentary in the narrative was a joking suggestion, but the group was all for it, and I had fun writing that script. The lines provided in this post are a few of the small selections that play at random intervals in the game.</p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJpUQssalBM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></p>",
