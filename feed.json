Though we took a quite silly route with the subject matter (one may notice some parody aspects of Monopoly, as this was not to be sold), the implementation was discussed and iterated on a lot with continuous playtesting to ensure that the gameplay still made sense and improved. There were several challenges with this game, including the odd theme and the limitation that gameplay had to take about twenty minutes total (hence the “exploding planet” time limit) and so we had to adapt a lot as a team. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-xs.png 300w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-sm.png 480w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-md.png 768w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-lg.png 1024w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-xl.png 1360w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/4/responsive/Screen-Shot-2020-09-21-at-20.05.20-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"663\" height=\"657\"></figure>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We adjusted this game continuously for the two weeks we were given for it, and I learned a lot about prioritising when it comes to physical prototyping.

The requirements were for it to be multiplayer and a combination of two sports. We chose American football and dodgeball. The scifi elements were added in just for the fun of it. </p>\n<p><strong>The Vision</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Our objective for this game was a fun, chaotic experience that players could share with others in the style of console party games. The theme for the project was to combine sports, and we came to the conclusion that American football and dodgeball would slot right into that vision. It made for a lot of fun, emergent gameplay, which was exactly the goal for us. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I found it remarkably simple and fun to adapt to the group vision in this project. We had clear agreement on what we wanted and when that changed, changing the concept was easy for me. The important part for me here was that I knew when people wanted things to change, and keeping it cohesive through those changes was a fun challenge for me. </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Ball_Spawner_01.jpg\" data-size=\"670x921\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Ball_Spawner_01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"670\" height=\"921\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ball Spawner</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Character-concept.jpg\" data-size=\"1555x1755\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Character-concept-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"813\"></a>\n<figcaption>Character Concept Art</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Controller_Scheme.png\" data-size=\"1378x558\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Controller_Scheme-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"292\"></a>\n<figcaption>Controls</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Environment_Concept_03.jpg\" data-size=\"3000x1483\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/2/gallery/Environment_Concept_03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"356\"></a>\n<figcaption>Arena Concept Art</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><strong>Communication, narrative, and scripting</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was another project in which I learned heaps about communication between the different disciplines. Here we had access to 2D artists and programmers in addition to the designers and 3D artists. I believe both the 3D artists and I found it immensely helpful to have access to a 2D department which could help us visualise our ideas into concepts to come to a clear vision between us. We had a scrum master for this project and the communication in the team was great. We had room to test, dismiss, and use more ideas than we had originally thought we could.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this project, I did some more narrative work in the form of an announcer for the game. Though a lot of my work was cut due to time constraints, I am proud of the work that made it in. I also got to personally coach the voice (the scrum master) in this context, and that experience was a valuable one. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I also stepped outside my comfort zone with this project and took a more active part in the scripting of it than I did with Escape in Frogress. I learned a lot about not just the technological aspect, but also of the structure the team needs to be effective with it. Working with programmers was also new, and I value that experience.</span></p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffD1dvwsDMY\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></p>",

We were presented with two requirements: that the game be multiplayer, and that the characters be made up of more than one part in some way (we chose a connection between the character's body itself and the tongue (used to grapple through the level)).</p>\n<p>As a team, we sat down and settled o<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">n an idea through some trial and error. Once we had a base idea, we divided into groups for each aspect of a first playable, to be done at the end of the week. I was part of the level design and did the first blockout of it. I then worked with artists to continue developing the level. </span></p>\n<p>In the second week, I was responsible for narrative (voice line script), playtesting, and creating the pitch for the project to be pres<span style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\">ented to the school. I was also the presenter. </span></p>\n<p><strong>A New Experience</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This was my first game project at Future Games. I was very familiar with the concept of creating a narrative and creative writing, and translating that to game production was something of a challenge, but one that was fun to take on. I've toyed with narrative concepts in games before, but that was more linear stories. This was a matter of flavour to an otherwise focused experience, and writing a script for it was a lot of fun. </span></p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  style=\"color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);\" src=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/Orange-Frog-Midair.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-xs.png 300w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-sm.png 480w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-md.png 768w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-lg.png 1024w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-xl.png 1360w ,https://RebeccaWikman.github.io/media/posts/1/responsive/Orange-Frog-Midair-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1040\"></figure>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" allow=\"autoplay\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/897052870%3Fsecret_token%3Ds-BNn9rfpFpqu&amp;color=%2300cc11&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></div></p>\n<div style=\"font-size: 10px; color: #cccccc; line-break: anywhere; word-break: normal; overflow: hidden; white-space: nowrap; text-overflow: ellipsis; font-family: Interstate,Lucida Grande,Lucida Sans Unicode,Lucida Sans,Garuda,Verdana,Tahoma,sans-serif; font-weight: 100;\"><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-267311361\" title=\"Sage\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">Sage</a> · <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/user-267311361/vo-line04/s-BNn9rfpFpqu\" title=\"VO Line04\" target=\"_blank\" style=\"color: #cccccc; text-decoration: none;\" rel=\"noopener\">VO Line04</a></div>\n<p><strong>Learning Communication</strong></p>\n<p>A big part of what I learned was how the communication in a game dev team works. I had worked with communication in teaching before, and so this was new to me. I worked on the level, the concept, and the voice lines that play randomly throughout the game, and each part required a lot of communication with the other designers and the artists.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I was part of the level layout and design in this project, and as such I kept up communication with the 3D artists on what we needed for the level and how we should implement it. They taught me a lot about the depth and readability of a level as well, which I think was one of the more valuable bits of information I got from it. Regular standups and check-ins also ensured that I knew how, where, and when the other designers were working with the mechanics and characters, as well as the camera view. </span></p>\n<p>Forming an idea as a team was entirely new. I have collaborated before, but not in a group bigger than four. Settling on a base idea and adapting to it was surprisingly fun, as I had to find new avenues of influencing it. The idea of parodying a nature documentary in the narrative was a joking suggestion, but the group was happy to run with it, and I had fun writing that script. Below are some of the lines I provided: </p>\n<p><strong>Voice Lines.</strong></p>\n<p>An artist, Karl Johansson<strong>, </strong>provided the Attenborough voice, which added a lot to the game in my opinion. </p>\n<p>I was also part of presenting this project to the teachers as well as the pitch, which I presented to the school. This is something I was more used to due to my background in teaching, and it was a very fun subject to present. </p>\n<p><div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YJpUQssalBM\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div></p>",
